add titles and descriptions
maybe some more mappings, too?


differences in modeling 

caching of uniprot annotations

The semantic-synbio/synbio-schema GitHub repository contains a semantic model suitable for containing synthetic biology knowledge, along with representative scripts for populating a database with knowledge from one source, in accordance with that schema. Our example source includes known sequence modifications, so this pipeline identifies the protein coding modification with blast searches, along with retrieval of sequence annotations

runs on modern multi-core personal computer or laptop

future:


consolidate directories:
- blastdbs
- data
- examples
- resources
- target
